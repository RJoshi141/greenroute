# GreenRoute

A modern web application that helps users plan **eco-friendly commutes** by comparing routes based on  
**CO₂ emissions, time, and cost**, while also enabling **carpool matching** and tracking sustainability impact.



### Features (MVP)
✔ Plan routes and compare transport options (Car, Transit, Bike, Walk, Carpool)  
✔ CO₂ impact visualization and emissions savings calculator  
✔ Carpool/ride-share discovery and matching  
✔ Personal dashboard for tracking weekly/monthly impact  
✔ Gamification: badges, leaderboard, and green streaks  


### Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Frontend | Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind |
| Backend | Node.js / API Routes (expandable to Express/NestJS) |
| Data | Prisma + PostgreSQL |
| Maps | Mapbox / Google Maps API |
| Auth | Clerk / NextAuth (TBD) |
| Deployment | Vercel + Railway / Supabase / Render |



### Project Goal

To build a **resume-ready full-stack application** that showcases:

- Real map/geolocation UI  
- API design and route ranking logic  
- Database modeling with Prisma  
- Sustainable tech impact (CO₂ tracking)  
- Production-level architecture & deployment readiness
